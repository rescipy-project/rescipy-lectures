**Tutorials on Python for scientific research.**

reScipy lectures is a collection of tutorials aiming to provide researchers with documentation to easily start performing scientific data analysis with the Python programming language.

These tutorials are heavily based on the `Scientific Python Lecture Notes <https://scipy-lectures.org/>`_, while they attempt to provide additional information on the Python ecosystem, specifically for scientific research.

This website is part of the `reScipy project <https://rescipy-project.readthedocs.io>`_.
